STRANGER THINGS 2: Ladies and gentlemen, that's how you do it: no bullshit, balls to the wall entertainment. Straight up.

------------------

Molly, aka the Thing of Evil, will be publishing soon. The working title is EVERYONE MUST BOW DOWN BEFORE ME.

------------------

I and both of my sons are together on the NY Times bestseller list, SLEEPING BEAUTIES at #4 and Joe's STRANGE WEATHER at #9. Awesome!

------------------

@realDonaldTrump @POTUS While you're releasing the JFK files, why not release your tax returns?

------------------

What makes CHANCE so cool is the unlikely bromance between the doctor (Hugh Laurie) and the hulking hitman (Ethan Suplee) who befriends him.

------------------

RIP Fats Domino, one pf the last of the Founding Fathers. “Come on pretty baby, we’re gonna rock, gonna roll, until the early light.”

------------------

STRANGE WEATHER, by Joe Hill, goes on sale tomorrow.

------------------

@kittykays Yeah, THE NIGHT MANAGER was killer.

------------------

Enjoyed THE HANDMAID'S TALE on Hulu? Go back and take a chance on CHANCE. Hugh Laurie's never been better.

------------------

Next week: STRANGE WEATHER, by Joe Hill. It's a gem. Am I prejudiced, sure, but Kirkus says "pitch perfect"; PW touts "emotional resonance."

------------------

@HeerJeet @BevVincent They also don't remember who hosted CONCENTRATION or THE MATCH GAME. Maybe a good thing.

------------------

By the way, the unabridged audio of SLEEPING BEAUTIES, read by Marin Ireland, is--as Eugene of TWD would say--totally hunky-dunky.

------------------

Twitter congregation sez THE END OF THE WORLD RUNNING CLUB is available on audio, and it's supposedly good.

------------------

THE END OF THE WORLD RUNNING CLUB, by Adrian J. Walker. This one's a real find. I got a copy in Toronto. Might not be published in the US.

------------------

TIGERS ARE NOT AFRAID, directed by Issa Lopez: this is one terrific film, both tough and touching. Two minutes in, I was under its spell.

------------------

Thanks to you Toronto  book readers who came out tonight to support SLEEPING BEAUTIES. You were great! Owen and I thank you.

------------------

Great tour date for SLEEPING BEAUTIES in Portland last night. Owen and I thank you for coming out.

------------------

My son Owen King and I had a great time talking SLEEPING BEAUTIES in Naperville last night. You guys were great! Thank you!

------------------

Donald Trump, the master of self-congratulation. His picture should be next to NARCISSIST in the dictionary.

------------------

SLEEPING BEAUTIES tour info on my site and Owen's.

------------------

Thanks to everyone who came out to the Fisher Center last night, to listen as Owen King &amp; I talked about SLEEPING BEAUTIES. Had a blast.

------------------

Thanks to everyone who came out to support me and Owen and SLEEPING BEAUTIES last night in Brooklyn. We had a great time, and hope you did.

------------------

SLEEPING BEAUTIES will be in bookstores on Tuesday. Read it! You'll float! But you WON'T sleep!

------------------

Kim and Don, schoolyard bullies bumping shoulders. 
"Take it back, asshole!" 
"No, YOU take it back!"
"Dickwad!'
"Buttmunch!"
Really, kids.

------------------

Here again--for the last time, I promise--the British promo for SLEEPING BEAUTIES. Worth posting, 'cos it's good.
 https://t.co/Nmn6bLuZ50 !

------------------

I see Trump wished the USAF a happy 70th birthday. Still waiting for him to wish me one.

------------------

Location manager of Netflix show NARCOS reported killed in Mexico.

------------------

SLEEPING BEAUTIES, by me and my son Owen, is almost here. Hope y'all enjoy. It cooks.

------------------

George Lebay said that, played by Roberts Blossom.
Well, I fucked up. But Harry Dean SHOULD have said it.

------------------

A television miracle! Homicidal young Norman Bates becomes a genius doctor! WHO SAYS PEOPLE CAN'T CHANGE???

------------------

MR. MERCEDES is back tonight on Audience Network tonight. Climb on board, you guys. (Not you, Donald.)

------------------

Twitter response to 1,000 satellite channels of crap: WHY ARE THERE SO MANY COOKING SHOWS? To which I'd add: BRING BACK WILFORD BRIMLEY!

------------------

Sorry to hear Tobe Hooper passed. He did a terrific job directing the 'SALEM'S LOT miniseries, back in the day. He will be missed.

------------------

What he said. Although the sunlight did take on a peculiar GREENISH tinge. https://t.co/AWQa5GauO0

------------------

MR. MERCEDES is back behind the wheel tonight. Episode 2. Audience Network. Be there if you can.

------------------

And don't forget to ride with MR. MERCEDES this Wednesday on Audience. Check yer local listings, as they say.

------------------

Thanks to all of you who went to Mid-world this past weekend and made THE DARK TOWER the #1 movie in America.

------------------

THE DARK TOWER today. Everywhere. May it do ya fine.

------------------

DARK TOWER tomorrow; MR. MERCEDES next week; IT and SLEEPING BEAUTIES next month. All good. Lucky me.

------------------

Episode 2 of THE HANDMAID'S TALE takes surrogacy to an entirely new level. I was suitably creeped out.

------------------

Thanks to two brave women and one brave--and possibly doomed--man, the ACA lives.

------------------

Writing a story or a novel? Great! Want a tip? NEVER use the phrase "for a long moment."

------------------

MY ABSOLUTE DARLING, by Gabriel Tallent, coming next month. This is one shattering can't-put-it down book. Both shocking &amp; tender. Read it.

------------------

Re solos: There's that crazy whatever-it-is--synth?--in "Won't Get Fooled Again." An audio LSD trip.

------------------

It's true THE DARK TOWER movie runs a clean 95 minutes. Like the first book in the series (224 pages), it's all killer and no filler.

------------------

MR. MERCEDES is roaring your way August 9th, and this baby runs on BLOOD.
https://t.co/qkswAPRsI4

------------------

THE DARK TOWER is coming. Three weeks and change. As Roland would say, "Be there, doya."

------------------

Let's be clear: Trump's "fake news" obsession is about HONEST news coverage that is unfavorable to him. Pandering to his shrinking base.

------------------

I saw BABY DRIVER this afternoon with a bunch of my friends. We hollered and clapped. It's that kind of movie. Ultimately cool.

------------------

Bumper sticker spotted today on a pickup truck: WHEN IN DOUBT, EMPTY THE CLIP. I leave the possibilities to your imagination.

------------------

SPIKE TV tonight, at 10 PM. The premiere. I get MISTy-eyed, just thinking about it.

------------------

THE MIST TV series premieres on Spike, June 22nd. You might want to mark it on your calendar. It's really good.

------------------

Covfefe is from THE NECRONOMICON, and actually means "Hail Cuthulu!"

------------------

According to the HBO warning screen, THE LEFTOVERS features violence, but, thank God, only "Brief Nudity."

------------------

THE 100 Season 4 finale on the 24th. I can't wait.

------------------

Obama on Trump, as quoted in PEOPLE magazine: "He's nothing but a bullshitter."

------------------

Trump releases classified info to the Russians. Not fake news; not liberal bias. Folks, HE'S DOING THIS TO HIMSELF.

------------------

What some good summer reading? Grab all 3 volumes of Greg Iles's NATCHEZ BURNING trilogy. Pure suspense, pure backroads Americana.

------------------

DESIGNATED SURVIVOR keeps getting better, and isn't Maggie Q something? Terrific performance.

------------------

THE DARK TOWER trailer is here. And it's awesome.
https://t.co/UEQjfkuvRZ

------------------

Best TWD line of the year belongs to Eugene: "...it can change the game of our food situation from critical to hunky-dunky."

------------------

The MR. MERCEDES series is really good. And if you watch closely, you just might see yours truly.

------------------

GOLDEN PREY, by John Sanford: The best Lucas Davenport story so far. The man has a fine touch for outlaws. Next week. Get it. Over and out.

------------------

New book by FOX News: Killing Bill O'Reilly.

------------------

I found out about HOTEL BEAU SEJOUR from Bev Vincent. You should follow him.

------------------

HOTEL BEAU SEJOUR, on Netflix: Eccentric, brilliant, and strangely touching. Supernatural fare for those who don't ordinarily like it.

------------------

THE MIST is coming.
 https://t.co/x35Cokra5H

------------------

For me, COLONY has replaced TWD as the most subversive show on cable TV. Looking forward to the finale tomorrow night.

------------------

THE MIST, MR. MERCEDES, 1922, GERALD'S GAME, THE DARK TOWER, and IT: Believe it or not, they all look awesome.

------------------

UK readers, you have a nice surprise coming. No, not Brexit, FEVER, by Deon Meyer. Reminiscent of THE STAND and THE PASSAGE. Great stuff.

------------------

OBAMACARE LIVES!!!!

------------------

RIP Bernie Wrightson, a good friend and a great collaborator. I will miss him.

------------------

THE 100: Call me a pessimist, but I wouldn't give you a dime for Bellamy's chances.

------------------

Pence has TRUSTWORTHY hair, but on a soap opera you would never trust it.

------------------

Melissa McBRIDE. Autocorrect did it. I HATE autocorrect. Must turn it off. Only what if it comes back? In the dark?

------------------

HULU is an ancient Chinese word meaning "holder of precious things." Just thought you'd like to know, in case you want to re-watch 11/22/63.

------------------

I MARRIED A MONSTER FROM OUTER SPACE is perhaps the best title in the history of cinema. Boom, you've got your whole story right there.

------------------

@blumhouse X-MEN LOST ENDING--"I can still see!" I saw it at the Ritz Theater, in Lewiston, Maine. Never forgot it.

------------------

THE WALKING DEAD last night: Scary zombies! Even scarier, a sign for deep fried butter! BTW, just how did Michonne get out of the trunk?

------------------

Trump should know OBAMA NEVER LEFT THE WHITE HOUSE! He's in the closet! HE HAS SCISSORS!

------------------

All politics aside, the Trump administration reminds me of that Tom Arnould movie, THE STUPIDS. Really, you guys, this is embarrassing.

------------------

THE GOOD FIGHT: It's good to have Diane Lockhart back. By the second episode, I'd stopped missing Alicia. (Well, I still miss her a little.)

------------------

FAKE NEWS: Evolution. REAL NEWS: The earth is 6,000 years old.

------------------

FAKE NEWS: Adolescent males enjoy superhero movies. REAL NEWS: Adolescent males enjoy Mike Pence interviews on FOX News.

------------------

Oh, wait! Is Paul Harvey dead? FAKE NEWS. Paul Harvey is alive and well, living in Graceland.

------------------

In addition to being compulsively readable, nowhere in Don Winslow's THE FORCE will you find "for a long moment" or "for some reason."

------------------

Don Winslow's THE FORCE (coming in June) is mesmerizing, a triumph. Think THE GODFATHER, only with cops. It's that good.

------------------

Aspiring fiction writer? Cool! Here are 2 phrases you must NEVER use: "for a long moment" and "for some reason." Find another way!

------------------

I've got an advance copy of Don Winslow's new novel, THE FORCE, and am starting this weekend, so who's better than me?
:-)

------------------

Anyway, you should read BEHIND HER EYES. Even if it's not a thumping good read, it's bloody brilliant.

------------------

Spent most of the day reading the second half of BEHIND HER EYES, by Sarah Pinborough. What the Brits call "a thumping good read." Bravo!

------------------

Saw a rough cut of Mike Flanagan's GERALD'S GAME yesterday. Horrifying, hypnotic, terrific. It's gonna freak you out.

------------------

Court ruling: Basically what the judges said was this: "Fear of the boogeyman does NOT allow the trashing of the Constitution."

------------------

Anybody besides me think Bellamy on THE 100 looks and sounds like Ben Affleck?

------------------

NO SECOND CHANCE, a six-part French adaptation of Harlan Coben's novel. Terrific entertainment.

------------------

Figured out Pence's face. The whole thing grows when he lies, not just his nose. He's SUPER Pinocchio!

------------------

Time to gather Skaikru fans. THE 100 is back.

------------------

@joe_hill What it's like to be shot from a cannon? See the reviews I got on NEEDFUL THINGS.

Please ask Susan Collins, a SANE Republican senator, to vote against the totally unqualified Betsy DeVos.

------------------

RIP William Peter Blatty, who wrote the great horror novel of our time. So long, Old Bill.

------------------

THE AUTOPSY OF JANE DOE: Visceral horror to rival ALIEN and early Cronenberg. Watch it, but not alone.

------------------

YOU WILL KNOW ME, by Megan Abbott: What an excellent novel. Gave me the creeps in the best possible way.

------------------

@OwenGleiberman @Variety I felt LA LA LAND was overpraised by critics who dug the retro vibe. It was a fine entertainment, but great? No.

------------------

RIP Carrie Fisher, and don't forget Richard Adams. Fine writer.

------------------

The first great thriller of 2017 is almost here: FINAL GIRLS, by Riley Sager. If you liked GONE GIRL, you'll like this.

------------------

Loving THE TWENTY-THREE, by Linwood Barclay. You should treat yourself to the whole Promise Falls trilogy.

------------------

Thanks to Goodreads readers for picking END OF WATCH. https://t.co/WgWNpQJE6M

------------------

TRAIN TO BUSAN: Holy shit, it's like John Woo meets the zombie apocalypse. This makes THE WALKING DEAD look tame.

------------------

Anybody remember THE CAINE MUTINY? It seems that Americans may have elected Captain Queeg president.

------------------

I just read a charming children's book called CHARLIE THE CHOO-CHOO. You should buy 2 copies! Perhaps 5! Only wish I had written it!

One more thing before I drift away for awhile: A common sign in antiques stores reading IF YOU BREAK IT, YOU OWN IT.

What everyone's saying: Trumpie loved the FBI while they were saying what he wanted to hear. Now, not so much.

FBI has cleared Clinton in the latest email go-round. Tempest in a teapot. Pro-Trump FBIers maybe trying to influence the vote.

I'm reading THE NIX, by Nathan Hill. Just started, but so far it's got me laughing hysterically. First 50 pages are worth the price.

The new issue of CEMETERY DANCE contains a new (and brilliant) short novel from Joe Hill. "Snapshot 1988" will blow your mind.

Laura Lippman's latest novel, WILDE LAKE, is a knockout. You should get right on that.

Love Samantha Mathis in THE STRAIN. She kicks ass.

Speaking of the good stuff, how about Mel Gibson in BLOOD FATHER? His best performance in years.

------------------

Reliable sources on Cthulu's denail he is Trump: "Well, it's what he WOULD say, isn't it?"

------------------

@CathyPegau @mharvey816 Are you SURE you're alone in your house?

------------------

I have a button that says CAN'T SLEEP, CLOWNS WILL EAT ME. Probably not true. But what if it was? What if they're just waiting?

------------------

I'm going to see SULLY this weekend. After 10 months of Donald Trump, I'm desperate for a real American hero.

------------------

I'm really sorry that TYRANT (FX) has been canceled. For 3 seasons it made sense of an insane situation, and in an entertaining way.

------------------

@Breznican Admit it, you want to see THE SNURKS.

------------------

Darrell in THE WALKING DEAD and Vasily Fet in THE STRAIN: The two coolest monster fighters on TV.

------------------

Sitting here with the headphones cranked, listening to Grandmaster Flash and RUN-DMC. IMHO just the way to ride Saturday night.

------------------

I like this time of year to go to the movies. Some interesting smaller films show up. Going to see DON'T BREATHE tonight.

------------------

THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD, by Colson Whitehead: Terrific novel of escape, sacrifice, and redemption. Reminded me a bit of Larry McMurtry.

------------------

Re THE GOOD WIFE: I like Alan Cumming (Eli). Always perfectly tailored, but always looking like a cat who just got sprayed with a hose.

------------------

3 seasons into THE GOOD WIFE, it's clear to me that Lockhart-Gardner would go bankrupt without Kalinda Sharma. She's their magic lamp.

------------------

Good cover story in TIME about the growing culture of hate on the internet. Helps to remember TROLL rhymes with ASSHOLE.

------------------

SLADE HOUSE, by David Mitchell: Hard to imagine a more finely wrought and chilling tale of the supernatural. One of the rare great ones.

------------------

Watching THE GOOD WIFE from the beginning. Into Season 2. God, is it smart. All the women have this Mona Lisa thing going.

------------------

50 GOP brainiacs wash their hands of Trump; Drudge Report ignores it.

------------------

Sen. Susan Collins says she won't vote for Trump. Drudge Report ignores it, but posts old pic of HRC being helped up a flight of stairs.

------------------

Molly, aka the Thing of Evil, takes a break from writing her 1st book, THE DOGSHIT CHRONICLES. A sure beast-seller. https://t.co/MdUl87J2MQ

------------------

Double feature at my house. CHARLEY VARRICK, followed by MR. MAJESTYK. With a Popeye cartoon.

------------------

If you want to cool off this summer with a fine horror novel, hunt up THE DEEP, by Nick Cutter. Scary as hell, and well written, to boot.

------------------

I love TYRANT. If you're not watching, kick your VOD in gear, and start at Season 1.

------------------

Molly, aka the Thing of Evil, and her Uncle McMurtry enact a play called THIS YEAR'S ELECTION. https://t.co/lJsAWPPuEN

------------------

One line I thankfully didn't have to listen to in STRANGER THINGS: "Excuse me a minute, I have to take this."

------------------

NY Times report Trump's duds are made in China.  Guess MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN doesn't apply to the clothing industry.

------------------

Ridley Pearson's new thriller, WHITE BONE, is in stores now. Perfect for summer. You couldn't do better.

------------------

One difference between Nixon and Trump: when the Republicans nominated Nixon, they didn't actually KNOW he was a crook.

------------------

STRANGER THINGS: Is it possible the Evil Man With the White Hair isn't dead? Stay tuned.

------------------

Simon &amp; Schuster booth! Noon! Y'might even get it SIGNED by Ms. Evans! As Trump says, "Who the hell knows?"

------------------

Hey, kids! Got my copy of CHARLIE THE CHOO-CHOO by Beyl Evans, straight from Mid-World! Get yours! #SDCC, Friday! https://t.co/hRw82rcnDe

------------------

Speaking of the GOP convention, I wish I had the Ex-Lax concession. Never seen so many tight asses. I could retire.

------------------

STRANGER THINGS is pure fun. A+. Don't miss it. Winona Ryder shines.

------------------

@joe_hill As the recurring judge character on THE GOOD WIFE makes attorneys say, "In my opinion."

------------------

Watching STRANGER THINGS is looking watching Steve King's Greatest Hits. I mean that in a good way.

------------------

My only question about the Netflix series STRANGER THINGS is whether or not it will be popular enough to crash their servers. It  might be.

------------------

It's so great to have TYRANT back.

------------------

FBI to Clinton: You're careless.
American voters to Crazy Uncle Don: You're clueless.

------------------

HBO's THE NIGHT OF is brilliant entertainment. Great acting and a great story by Richard Price. You should get on board for this one.

------------------

Take it back, you guys, take it back, TAKE IT BACK.

------------------

Gee, looks like NOBODY killed Freddie Gray. Guess he just died of being black. Funny how that happens in this country.

------------------

Paul Tremblay's uber-creepy follow-up to A HEAD FULL OF GHOSTS is published today: DISAPPEARANCE AT DEVIL'S ROCK. Don't miss this one.

------------------

Money from the "Guns" essay goes to the James Brady Organization to Prevnt Handgun Violence. They do NOT advocate outlawing guns.

------------------

END OF WATCH is published Tuesday. Hope to see a lot of you guys on the tour!

------------------

Oh yeah, and END OF WATCH, coming out in a week or so. That's also pretty good, I think.

------------------

Can't forget THE GIRLS, by Emma Cline, and freakin' EVERYTHING by Sarah Waters.

------------------

Oh, and you might as well add Justin Cronin's PASSAGE trilogy, now that it's complete.

------------------

THE SECOND LIFE OF NICE MASON, by Steve Hamilton, THE NICEVILLE TRILOGY, by Carsten Stroud. There. Summer reading problems solved.

------------------

Joe Hill's THE FIREMAN to debut at #1 on the NY Times bestseller list. Way to go, kid. All the love.

------------------

Nice trailer for END OF WATCH, coming next month.
https://t.co/Ksn6vwFjy8

------------------

Each episode of THE WALKING DEAD is a bracing shot of nihilism. FEAR THE WALKING DEAD, on the other hand, just seems dour.

------------------

I thought my friend Jack Bender, who directed so many great LOST episodes, just turned in the episode of the year on GAME OF THRONES.

------------------

For those of you thinking He Who Must Not Be Named will be playing the Crimson King in THE DARK TOWER...good guess, but wrong.

------------------

Heat up your spring reading with Joe Hill's THE FIREMAN. It will spark your interest and charbroil your nerves.

------------------

PRISON BREAK is coming back, and I can't wait. More T-Bag.

------------------

CBS news report on opioid addiction partially sponsored by a drug to help you shit when you're on opioids. What a world we live in.

------------------

THE FIREMAN, by Joe Hill, published tomorrow. Extraordinary. You'll burn your way through it.

------------------

Congratulations to Paul Tremblay, who just won the Stoker Award for A HEADFUL OF GHOSTS! Told you it was good!

------------------

That was the best episode of THE 100. Clarke said she was sorry, but you can't blame her this time.

------------------

T-shirt idea for the Republican convention: THE DEVIL MADE US DO IT! VOTE FOR OMEN 3!

------------------

THE 100: Man, awfully late in the season for such a flashback-heavy episode. It was nice to see Bellamy grow up a little, though.

------------------

ALL THINGS CEASE TO APPEAR, by Elizabeth Brundage: Ghosts, murder, a terrifying psychotic who seems normal, and beautiful writing. Loved it.

------------------

Please note: Clarke did not say "I'm sorry" on this week's episode, A SINGLE TIME!!!

------------------

Today's best bumper sticker: THE CLOSER YOU GET, THE SLOWER I GO.

------------------

THE 100: Although one of my favorites died, Emori continues to brighten the story. Luisa D'Oliveria's smile always makes me feel happy.

------------------

How good is HUSH? Up there with HALLOWEEN and--even more--WAIT UNTIL DARK. White knuckle time. On Netflix.

------------------

In Linwood Barclay's excellent FAR FROM TRUE, mayor Randall Finley reminded me strongly of the late Rob Ford. Wonder if it was intentional.

------------------

The sad (but true) mantra that's repeated over and over in THE 100: "There are no good guys."

------------------

What I like best about THE 100 is the strong feminist slant. No preaching, just story.

------------------

Challenge for the writers of THE 100: Get through Season 4 without Clarke saying "I'm sorry" more than, say, 10 times.

------------------

THE DARK TOWER movie is filming; IT begins soon. Pretty cool.

------------------

Harlan Coben's awesome series, THE FIVE, starts on Sky 1 April 15th. I got an advance look and loved it.

------------------

Re THE 100: You think, "They're not really gonna go there, are they?" And then they do. On to Season 3.

------------------

Totally hooked on THE 100. Harsh and propulsive.

------------------

Molly, aka the Thing of Evil, hides from the FBI after stealing the mailman's bag of dog biscuits. Federal crime. https://t.co/5Czav6alZt

------------------

BRIGHTON, by Michael Harvey: Helluva Boston crime novel. Helluva novel, period. If you liked THE DEPARTED, you'll like this. Drops in June.

------------------

@linwood_barclay Love it. Glad you liked it. Can't wait for BROKEN PROMISE.

------------------

"You're never alone...in THE CHOPPING MALL." Somehow missed a Best Picture nomination, but check out the trailer.
https://t.co/aC8i4yNoR9

------------------

If you liked GONE GIRL and THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN, you might want to pick up THE WIDOW, by Fiona Barton. Engrossing. Suspenseful.

------------------

Photo's from the forthcoming book, HEARTS IN SUSPENSION. Hopefully this fall.

------------------

Oops. EVER have to shave. Must proofread Tweets.

------------------

The National Enquirer CEO is David Pecker. Where are Beavis and Butthead when we need them?

------------------

Extensive coverage of ISIS scumbuckets is like pumping oxygen into a housefire. They thrive on the coverage.

------------------

Of course, the rallies held by He Who Must Not Be Named ARE reality shows, often reminding me in a weird way of DUCK DYNASTY.

------------------

In the film take on DEAD ZONE, Martin Sheen plays He Who Must Not Be Named. In the film version of ALL THE KING'S MEN, Broderick Crawford.

------------------

Or ALL THE KING'S MEN, by Robert Penn Warren, published in 1947, the year I was born.

------------------

Populist demagogues like He Who Must Not Be Named aren't a new thing; see THE DEAD ZONE, published 37 years ago.

------------------

Saw 10 CLOVERFIELD today with my posse. We had a blast. It's a killer thriller.

------------------

Sarah Paulson as Marcia Clark inAMERICAN CRIME STORY: The performance of a lifetime. This is what the word "bravura" means.

------------------

Republican debate: The whole world is laughing at us. SOMEBODY SHUT THESE CLOWNS UP.

------------------

@GeekyBooks @neilhimself You should read all of Neil's books, but I'd start with AMERICAN GODS.

------------------

The Republican determination to block a SCOTUS hearing is shameful and petty. Write your senator, if he's up for blocking this, okay?

------------------

In a year of remarkable TV, COLONY is really something special: smart, suspenseful, subversive...thought-provoking.

------------------

Justin Cronin's CITY OF MIRRORS is fantastic. An incredibly satisfying conclusion to his vampire trilogy.

------------------

To everyone who watched the debut of 11.22.63, just one word: THANKS. Oh, and four more: COME BACK NEXT WEEK!

------------------

The stupidest, ugliest Presidential campaign in my entire life: HOUSE OF CARDS meets SHARKNADO.

------------------

I mean, there's PARADISE FALLS, by Don Robertson, but beyond that...?

------------------

@KristenGBaldwin Only a veteran of REVENGE would have such insight. Bwa-haha

------------------

My favorite vintage paperback cover line: "Liz hit the gutter...AND BOUNCED LOWER!"

------------------

JANE GOT A GUN: A really good Western. Made me think of HOMBRE, with Paul Newman.

------------------

The only thing I missed in CITY ON FIRE was mention of NYC's proto-punk group, The Fugs. I'd love to see a bio movie of those guys.

------------------

@FkMyTweets666 Yes. Also THE TWELVE. Looking forward to CITY OF MIRRORS, the final volume in the trilogy.

------------------

CITY ON FIRE, by Garth Risk Hallberg: Dickensian, massively  entertaining, as close to a great American novel as this century has produced.

------------------

I keep thinking about the characters on SONS OF ANARCHY. And missing them.

------------------

RIP David Bowie. Great singer, great innovator, great style.

------------------

Loved the first 2 Robert Galbraith novels, THE CUCKOO'S CALLING and THE SILKWORM. Terrific whodunits--classic--and the writing is wonderful.

------------------

@KristenGBaldwin @chuckecheese Jesus, what are those RED THINGS????

------------------

Lots of new shows coming this month, but don't miss THE COLONY (on USA). Great premise, fine acting. Great to see Josh Holloway (LOST) back.

------------------

Looking forward to THE CITY OF MIRRORS in 2016, the anxiously awaited conclusion of Justin Cronin's PASSAGE trilogy.

------------------

I must tell the truth: My friend Barbara gave her that ribbon. I DID give her a pat.

------------------

Happy holidays, you Twitterheads. Love &amp; peace to all of you, even the NRA types and those willing to vote for He Who Must Not Be Named.

------------------

@ChrisNashawaty I think that's from BURNT OFFERINGS.

------------------

The irony of THE AFFAIR is that Scott Lockhart wasn't really up to much, anyway. Although his version of "Rising Sun" was pretty good.

------------------

The first episode of AMERICAN CRIME is available. Free on iTunes, maybe other platforms, too. This is exceptional stuff. Check it out.

------------------

I can no longer tweet about Trump. That anyone in America would even CONSIDER voting for this rabid coyote leaves me speechless.

------------------

I can no longer tweet about Trump. That anyone in America would even CONSIDER voting for this rabid coyote leaves me speechless.

------------------

CLOSE YOUR EYES: The best Michael Robotham novel yet. Once I reached the last 100 pages, it really was impossible to put down.

------------------

The current episode of FARGO may be the best thing on TV in the last three years. Terrifying and hilarious.

------------------

@KristenGBaldwin Love is also exchanging eye-rolls with your wife while watching THE AFFAIR.

------------------

I've read Joe Hill's forthcoming novel, THE FIREMAN (I happen to know the author). It's mind-blowingly good. Save your nickels &amp; dimes kids.

------------------

No one wants to ban private gun ownership, but the automatic weapons murders will continue until the NRA agrees to reasonable controls.

------------------

Google consensus on that question appears to be O.J. Simpson. I'd go more for whoever's running ISIS these days.

------------------

As the late great Forrest J. Ackerman (aka the Ackermonster) would say, HAPPY THANKSGRAVING!!

------------------

If THE AFFAIR were my show, it would turn out Noah is taking the rap for his headstrong daughter, Whitney.

------------------

Thought of a quote preceding THE CUCKOO'S CALLING when reading about Charlie Sheen:"Unhappy is he whose fame makes his misfortunes famous."

------------------

@kafvautour THE DARK HALF is the favorite book of Molly, aka the Thing of Evil.

------------------

Thanks to all the Constant Readers who made THE BAZAAR OF BAD DREAMS a #1 bestseller.

------------------

THE AFFAIR only works for me as a social comedy, with the occasional dramatic fillip.

------------------

Drug companies spending millions to sell sleeping pills and to make sure American men can get it up after the Sunday NFL games are over.

------------------

Watch AMERICA'S FUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS with the sound turned off, and a lot of clips look downright sadistic.

------------------

RIP Gunnar Hansen. Scared the shit out of me as Leatherface; in person, you never met a kinder man.

------------------

@linwood_barclay Yes! A dinner jacket! And she shows up in a French lace slip and then some kind of formal wear. And THEY NEVER GET DIRTY!!!

------------------

THE QUICK, by Lauren Owen: A terrific (and terrifying) novel of the undead in London. Completely involving, impossible to put down.

------------------

What scares me? Live TV! Nevertheless, I must go on GOOD MORNING AMERICA tomorrow and flog my book.

------------------

THE BAZAAR OF BAD DREAMS on sale Tuesday. Watch out for that bad little kid in the beanie with the propeller on it.

------------------

Happy Halloween, all you boys and ghouls.  Want to extend Fright Night? THE BAZAAR OF BAD DREAMS is out next week. Just sayin'.

------------------

Incompetent GOP candidates, no doubt, but the questions they had to field were even worse. That debate was embarrassing--a carny sideshow.

------------------

My chance to play DJ on a cool BBC radio show. Check it out.
https://t.co/QgHWHAbFiJ

------------------

THE FINAL GIRLS is really great, a sweet horror movie spoof that winds up feeling like MOONRISE KINGDOM.

------------------

@AmeliaHeartwood Final Mr. Mercedes book in June. END OF WATCH. It's nasty, but hey, it's what I do.

------------------

THE BAZAAR OF BAD DREAMS, my book of stories, drops in 2 weeks. Hope you like it, and watch out for the monster car that opens the book.

------------------

On the END OF WATCH cover: Watch out for that pink fish. I wouldn't touch it, if I were you.

------------------

@JonasSamuelle Darn. I TREASURED this one, dude.

------------------

THE GREEN INFERNO is like a glorious throwback to the drive-in movies of my youth: bloody, gripping, hard to watch, but you can't look away.

------------------

Auto-correct wanted to retitle Joseph Conrad's NOSTROMO as NOSTRUM. Who invented this monster?

------------------

THE BLIND MAN'S GARDEN, by Nadeem Aslam: An eye-opening, heartbreaking novel of the war in Afghanistan. Reminded me of Conrad's NOSTROMO.

------------------

THESE FINAL HOURS, a film by Zak Hilditch: Australian, low budget, hypnotic, and absolutely wrenching. Available VOD. Recommended.

------------------

Saw AMERICAN ULTRA last night, and loved it. Fresh and exciting, very cool. Can't figure out why it isn't a smash.

------------------

Don't let the summer go by without checking out THE NICEVILLE TRILOGY, by Carsten Stroud. It's a real rocket ride.

------------------

I'm going to see SINISTER 2 tomorrow. I loved the first one, found it genuinely disturbing and extremely well acted.

------------------

A HEAD FULL OF GHOSTS, by Paul Tremblay: Scared the living hell out of me, and I'm pretty hard to scare.

------------------

I've seen DIVERGENT and am moving on to INSURGENT. Next up: DETERGENT.

------------------

On the subject of great summer reads: LAST WORDS, by Michael Koryta. You can't put this baby down.

------------------

INTRO TO ALIEN INVASION, by Owen King and Mark Jude Poirier, coming next month. Great stuff. Not yet saying that because Owen King's my son.

------------------

@NicolinaTorres My favorite Tabby book is ONE ON ONE.

------------------

@dlpphoto Start her with THE GIRL WHO LOVED TOM GORDON.

------------------

@LaBombeH I'm reading LUCKIEST GIRL ALIVE, by Jessica Knoll. Only 20 pages in, hard to tell how good it will be, but the woman is witty.

------------------

@JArthurMerritt Sue Snell from CARRIE is a registered nurse in Castle Rock.

------------------

Best last line from one of my books: A toss-up between CHRISTINE and THE STAND. Best last line from someone else's: EAST OF EDEN.

------------------

The decision to let Drill go in the most recent episode of THE WHISPERS is a plot absurdity. That development doesn't creak, it screeches.

------------------

Give yourself a gift and go see THE GIFT--a perfect little gem of a suspense movie. Added bonus: no characters wear Spandex suits.

------------------

How's this for a Trump campaign slogan: IF YOU'RE WHITE, YOU'RE ALL RIGHT! ANY OTHER HUE, I DON'T TRUST YOU.

------------------

THE WHISPERS is lots of fun, but I wouldn't mind hearing Drill's side of the story. I'm sure he has one.

------------------

Next year on AMC: THE JOGGING DEAD.

------------------

How about a novel featuring a man who's always late? Thinking of calling it GO SET YOUR WATCH, MAN.

------------------

Classic TYRANT line: "You are relieved of your command, General."

------------------

I'm enjoying the hell out of TYRANT. One-fiftieth the budget of GAME OF THRONES, but it still packs an (admittedly low budget) punch.

------------------

BAD COUNTRY, by CB McKenzie: Terrific crime/suspense/mystery novel, but the real revelation is his fresh and original voice.

------------------

My favorite is Frank Darabont's THE MIST. #WeekendRock

------------------

Bumper sticker idea: I'M ONE OF TRUMP'S CHUMPS. Jesus, how do I come up with these? Just lucky I guess.

------------------

@seangerace Will Patton reading PET SEMATARY would be awesome, but I have to get him to do the 3rd book of the Hodges Trilogy first!

------------------

Watch the critics clobber GO SET A WATCHMAN. "Thou shalt not monkey with our scared literary cows." For the rest of us: you go, girl!

------------------

THE POWER OF THE DOG and THE CARTEL, by Don Winslow: I'm totally swept up. You can't ask more for emotionally moving entertainment.

------------------

I am going to order that novel, EENY MEENIE.

------------------

I did NOT call on Paul LePage to resign. I called on him to either go to work or go back home.

------------------

Dennis Lehane's WORLD GONE BY is the best gangster novel since THE GODFATHER. Terrific story, shattering conclusion.

------------------

Hope you'll join me UNDER THE DOME tonight, because, as Judy Garland once said, "There's no place like Dome." (Actually, I said that.)

------------------

A great film noir line in the new Joseph Finder novel, THE FIXER: "She had a body harder than Chinese arithmetic."

------------------

Too many closed minds on gun control. Worse, far too many PROUDLY closed minds. Meanwhile, the American shooting gallery remains open.

------------------

GAME OF THRONES finale: that was...was...let me just say it was not what I expected. :-(

------------------

RIP Christopher Lee. He was the King of the Vampires.

------------------

FINDERS KEEPERS bangs the bestseller list at #1. How cool is that?

------------------

So good to see Dee Wallace in THE WHISPERS...and as beautiful as ever.

------------------

Besides being a good action movie and a fractured fairy tale, CHAPPIE is a surprisingly sharp satire of thug life.

------------------

Thanks to everyone who bought FINDERS KEEPERS yesterday and said nice things.

------------------

Wish Joe Hill a happy birthday! And if you buy one of his books today, YOU get the present!

------------------

FINDERS KEEPERS published tomorrow. I'm stoked.

------------------

The book in the picture is THE MAN IN THE PICTURE, by Susan Hill. The Thing of Evil mustn't eat it. It's too good.

------------------

I found the premiere episode of WAYARD PINES outrageously entertaining. Matt Dillon is terrific.

------------------

TOMORROWLAND underperformed. I'm starting to think PG is box office poison; teens aren't interested. Animated films are an exception.

------------------

If you liked MISERY, you're probably going to like FINDERS KEEPERS. Some fans are just cockadoodie brats.

------------------

Almost time to go back UNDER THE DOME. I can't wait.

------------------

@KatyaPadalko Yes, I've thought about picking up the FIRESTARTER story for years. Charlie McGee would be all grown up now.

------------------

While on the subject of books: HYACINTH GIRLS, by Lauren Frankel. Haven't read it, but I'm going to. Looks great.

------------------

The new Sarah Lotz novel,DAY FOUR, is really good. USA edition comes out June 15. It's the cruise ship from hell.

------------------

MR. MERCEDES won the Edgar for Best Mystery Novel of 2014. What a thrill!

------------------

THE BORDER, by Robert McCammon: Rip-roaring, old-school SF. Mean aliens, heroic earthlings. Subterranean Press. Late May. I dug it.

------------------

THE AMERICANS, Episode 8, "Divestment:" What was up with that pin Martha was wearing? Looked sort of like Rudolph Nureyev.

------------------

@bad_garrett CRIMSON PEAK is terrific. Probably spoiled me for others, at least for awhile.

------------------

@isvbella Yes! THE BABADOOK! I tried to order the book for a few little kids I don't like.

------------------

@SoCalRamen DARK TOWER would probably get made quicker if they added some superheroes.

------------------

@ThatCharlieGuy Yeah! HOUSE OF THE DEVIL! Forgot that one. And the LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT remake.

------------------

Cronenberg's THE BROOD. THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. INSIDIOUS. Something like that. THE CHANGELING. THE DESCENT. A really cool remake of IT.

------------------

I'm OD'd on superhero movies. Would like a really scary horror movie. Seeing UNFRIENDED next week, so maybe that one.

------------------

I enjoyed BETTER CALL SAUL, and know it's supposed to be a boutique series, but on the whole I like AMERICAN CRIME much better.

------------------

Greg Stillson, in Cronenberg's version of THE DEAD ZONE: "The missiles are flying. Praise God."

------------------

@daveparke Zoey looks TOTALLY evil.

------------------

BETTER CALL SAUL, Episodes 1-3: What the hell year is this?

------------------

Thanks to the guy who told me SHAWSHANK is "the CASABLANCA of my generation, man." The credit goes to my man Frank Darabont.

------------------

CRIMSON PEAK electrified me in the same way Sam Rami's EVIL DEAD electrified me when I saw it for the first time way back in the day.

------------------

Was treated to a screening of Guillermo del Toro's new movie, CRIMSON PEAK, this weekend. Gorgeous and just fucking terrifying.

------------------

Looks like FINDERS KEEPERS, the new Hodges book, is almost ready. Out in June. Better than the first one, I think.

------------------

I've got a story in this week's NEW YORKER--"A Death." Hope you'll check it out and tell me what you think.

------------------

Best line in the extraordinary OLIVE KITTERIDGE: "For God's sake, Henry, you could make a woman sick." That's my Olive!

------------------

Another fun bumper sticker: DON'T LIKE MY DRIVING? DIAL 1-800-EAT-SHIT.

------------------

@linwood_barclay @MooreintheAM @newstalk1010 Mysterious tunnel? Wait, wait! WHAT mysterious tunnel? I must know more.

------------------

Saw a bumper sticker today, an oldie but a goody: HORN BROKEN, WATCH FOR FINGER. Man, I cracked up.

------------------

Reading the last book in Carsten Stroud's horror/suspense NICEVILLE trilogy, THE RECKONING. Out in August. Good God, what an achievement.

------------------

He (Cruz) also has this SAD look, like those big-eyed waifs in the velvet paintings. Don't mean to rap on him, but it's a little weird.

------------------

Trivia Night is the climax of BIG LITTLE LIES, by Linda Moriarty. It's a hell of a good book. Funny and scary. She nails the feuding moms.

------------------

BLACK SEA, with Jude Law: treasure hunters in an old leaky sub trying to salvage a fortune in Nazi gold. Jeez, what's not to like?

------------------

STORM OF THE CENTURY: "Give me what I want and I'll go away." Heh-heh-heh.

------------------

THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN, by Paula Hawkins: really great suspense novel. Kept me up most of the night. The alcoholic narrator is dead perfect.

------------------

@messy_notebook Say XLIX with an Aussie accent and it sounds even MORE like a cure for constipation. It's the true gen, mate.

------------------

AMERICA'S NEW CONGRESS looks like the same old shit to me.

------------------

Finishing THE PAYING GUESTS, by Sarah Waters. Awesome full-bodied novel. It's like she's saying, "Hey, dudes, this is how you do it."

------------------

I can't believe how many bad TAKEN jokes I've seen since yesterday. I was TAKEN ABACK.

------------------

HAPPY HOLIDAYS TO ALL, AND TO ALL A GOOD FRIGHT!

------------------

Frequently heard on the REVIVAL tour: "You scare the shit out of me! Can I have a hug?" People--gotta love 'em.

------------------

Theaters showing INTERVIEW could post a clear warning sign in their lobbies: VIEW AT YOUR OWN RISK. It works at amusement parks, right?

------------------

DEADLINE editorial: freedom of expression should only be defended when lives are not at risk. I think the Founding Fathers would disagree.

------------------

So if ASCENSION has been going on for over half a century, where are the old people?

------------------

I expect THE INTERVIEW to turn up online. Because, dig it, you can knock the rock but you can't stop the rock.

------------------

Sony's decision to pull THE INTERVIEW is unsettling in so many ways. Good thing they didn't publish THE SATANIC VERSES.

------------------

He's the guy who wrote THE IRON WILL OF SHOESHINE CATS. Also awesome. And a really cool title.

------------------

@magiciansbook Either THE LAST ONE LEFT or THE END OF THE NIGHT.

------------------

If you liked THE MIST, try DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN, by Brian Keene. Excellent short horror novel.

------------------

Still chewing over the last 90 seconds of the GRACEPOINT finale.

------------------

Jax Teller and Elvis: TCB to the end. Great finale.

------------------

Honey badger STILL don't give a shit.

------------------

@magiciansbook Quite possibly SMILED him to death.

------------------

@klbauthor In my version the three blind mice come back from the dead to exact horrifying revenge on the farmer's wife. REVENGE OF THE RATS.

------------------

Loved BLACK MIRROR. Terrifying, funny, intelligent. It's like THE TWILIGHT ZONE, only rated R.

------------------

THE BABBADOOK: Deeply disturbing and highly recommended. You don't watch it so much as experience it.

------------------

Great start to the GHOST BROTHERS tour last night--5 minute standing O. On to Toronto, November 11th!

------------------

Tix for GHOST BROTHERS still available in Toronto, Baltimore, and DC (I think). Hint: try Groupon.

------------------

@MyMelody6 @RealOldHouswife Noah and Alison are having an affair in a Showtime series called, obscurely enough, THE AFFAIR.

------------------

GHOST BROTHERS tour: Billy Burke (from TWILIGHT), Gina Gershon, Carlene Carter, more. Good acting and singing troupe.

------------------

And BTW, go see HORNS as a warm-up.

------------------

GHOST BROTHERS OF DARKLAND COUNTY is on tour as of 11/8. Lots of cities. Check it out &amp; go if you can:
http://t.co/pinVodhTwq

------------------

The new Rancid album, HONOR IS ALL WE KNOW, is a post-punk classic. Streaming free, too. Very cool.

------------------

@KellyBraffet @Breznican Right on. BRUTAL YOUTH is terrific.

------------------

THE WALKING DEAD last night: less talk, please, especially the heavily portentous kind, and more zombie-killin'.

------------------

@Creeper223 So YOU were that kid? I've been looking for you...

------------------

Thanks to all of you who watched BIG DRIVER and tweeted good things. Or that you were scared. I'm fine with that.

------------------

@shanewalshy WALKING DEAD was great. The first 15 minutes were mind-blowing.

------------------

Hard to trust the CDC with vampires overrunning New York on THE STRAIN.

------------------

Loved the season premiere of AMERICAN HORROR STORY. Bet Ray Bradbury would have, too.

------------------

Be warned: BIG DRIVER is authentically terrifying.

------------------

Holy shit, America! TWIN PEAKS is coming back next year, to Showtime! Agent Dale Cooper will drink more coffee!

------------------

@Peter_Germany Go for it! RESISTANCE IS FUTILE!
:-)

------------------

@AndrewBesson HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

------------------

A GOOD MARRIAGE: the little movie that could, thanks to all of you who ordered it. #12 on the iTunes store. Incredible.

------------------

My son's film, HORNS, is ALSO available via VOD today. Father and son movies! HOW COOL IS THAT???

------------------

A GOOD MARRIAGE is in theaters and available on VOD today. Check it out, and I hope you dig it.

------------------

A GOOD MARRIAGE--tomorrow. I'm stoked.

------------------

SONS OF ANARCHY: Fuckin' epic.

------------------

THE BLACKLIST is utterly over the top, but Reddington's je sais quoi is both impeccable and irresistible. Fun show in spite of itself.

------------------

A GOOD MARRIAGE opens Friday! Theaters in major markets and VOD! No competition but GONE GIRL, and who'll want to see that?

------------------

Curious about where I came from? Ancestors, etc.? Check out FINDING YOUR ROOTS tonight on PBS. 8 PM EDT. I was amazed.

------------------

UNDER THE DOME season finale: You're probably going to be shocked by what happens. I know I was. Check it out.

------------------

Watching a cool British series called PEAKY BLINDERS, and who turns up as the scuzzball father? Chibs Telford, aka Tommy Flanagan!

------------------

WAIT!!! Are you saying that "Boots and Pants" thing is a REAL SONG? I must have it!

------------------

@joe_hill @ViktoriaDeRoy THE RETURN OF THE KING, when Sam carries Frodo.

------------------

@jessehoveUSA I WAS Stephen King in the 3rd grade, and also turned out okay. (Mostly.)

------------------

The last 5 episodes of UNDER THE DOME totally rock.

------------------

@cavil2006 @hopper_m Some talk about turning THE REGULATORS into a TV series. How weird is that?

------------------

BROKEN MONSTERS, by Lauren Beukes: Scary as hell and hypnotic. I couldn't put it down. Next month.I'd grab it, if I were you.

------------------

I really like TYRANT, but aren't the opening credits ridiculously like GAME OF THRONES?

------------------

SONS OF ANARCHY: Best bro show ever. Can't wait for the new season.

------------------

I miss the Governor, on WALKING DEAD. He was a truly great villain.

------------------

Maine Democrats take note: Shenna Bellows is the real deal. She CAN beat Susan Collins.

------------------

RIP Johnny Winter. One of the blues greats. Best cover of "Good Morning Little Schoolgirl" ever.

------------------

Cool UTD tonight. A rain of blood always freshens things up.

------------------

STATE OF WONDER, by Ann Patchett: took me awhile to get around to it, but boy, was it worth it. Highest recommendation.

------------------

We're getting down to it on DOME tonight: too many people, not enough resources. Sound familiar?

------------------

I made Michael Grant's GONE series last, but finished the last one today. I am now free to leave the FAYZ, but my time there was well spent.

------------------

@Jarzen @Bethie15422027 LOVE IT!!!!!

------------------

Thanks to EVERYONE who watched our show last night. Natalie, we love you.

------------------

If you're hunting for me tomorrow night on UNDER THE DOME, look for the cap.

------------------

I'm in the opening episode of UNDER THE DOME, but you have to watch closely. It's a Where's Waldo kind of thing.

------------------

@gwfnycwf That's true, but I bet Ralph Fiennes could kick BOTH our asses.

------------------

@Jamie_G13 Yes, but are you sure that in SCHINDLER'S LIST that wasn't, like, the one actor who plays all the clones in ORPHAN BLACK?

------------------

@ArchStanton52 I guess I'll watch it. Michael Mann, right? He was making that in NC when I was doing MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE.

------------------

Brett Ratner's film of RED DRAGON needs to be re-evaluated. Amazing how fresh it looks. Like a new movie, almost.

------------------

So…who is your favorite ORPHAN BLACK clone? I have a Typical Guy fascination with Helena.

------------------

UNDER THE DOME 4 nights from now. Great cast and tight scripts. I'm pumped.

------------------

NICEVILLE and THE HOMECOMING, by Carsten Stroud: crazy-good supernatural/crime/horror epic. Blew me away.

------------------

@DeathMetalHero Almost all of Elmore Leonard is good, but I'd go back to when he started writing crime: SWAG or MR. MAJESTYK.

------------------

I guess I expected something a little more uplifting on the BOOKS page. Like "10 Novels Featuring Wardrobe Malfunctions."

------------------

"Using toilet seat liners is basically pointless." I found this on the HuffPost BOOKS page. Am I missing something?

------------------

To elaborate (sort of): What I posted was NOT a spoiler…but if I explained why, that WOULD be. Trust me.

------------------

MR. MERCEDES is the first novel in a projected trilogy. Hodges, Jerome, and Holly will return in FINDERS KEEPERS next year.

------------------

MR. MERCEDES is in stores today. Hope you guys like it. And if you don't, I'm sure you'll let me know. :-)

------------------

CRISIS is really great. What a shame it was canceled. Any chance one of the "adult" networks will pick it up? Volunteers?

------------------

Good news/bad news kind of thing: MR. MERCEDES comes out tomorrow, but I think Poe shut me down in the rap contest. :-(

------------------

MR. MERCEDES comes out day after tomorrow! Remember to buy one for all your relatives! HAHAHAHAHA.

------------------

I'm loving THE SOUTHERN REACH TRILOGY, by Jeff Vandermeer. Recommended by an indie bookseller. Creepy and fascinating.

------------------

According to Bev Vincent, here's the Canadian version of BREAKING BAD: "You have cancer. Your treatments start tomorrow. The End."

------------------

Loved 3 DAYS TO KILL, and miss Roger Ebert--he would have dug its action sequences and crazy, sentimental generosity.

------------------

@MauricioGomez_ HANNIBAL is literate, thoughtful, beautifully made, and full of crazed psychopaths. What's not to like?

------------------

After watching two seasons of HANNIBAL, I think a new license plate motto is in order: MARYLAND, HOME OF EXOTIC MURDER SCENES.

------------------

Re ORPHAN BLACK: Omally says it's Francis Bacon. Works for me.

------------------

Those ORPHAN BLACK episode titles: is it a poem? If so, which one?

------------------

@scottgtweets Right, and TRUE DETECTIVE. Also WALKING DEAD. HANNIBAL. CRISIS. FARGO. BATES MOTEL. And more!

------------------

After watching THE AMERICANS, SOA, and BREAKING BAD, I have to say most movies are starting to look old-fashioned and way behind the curve.

------------------

What if dead people started tweeting? There might be a story in that. Charles Dickens could tell how DROOD was supposed to end.

------------------

Somebody please make CNN stop with the plane coverage. It's time to move on.

------------------

DOING HARM, by Kelly Parsons: best damn medical thriller I've read in 25 years. Terrifying OR scenes, characters with real texture.

------------------

@johnklima Yes, don't worry, Hamlet lives. See him in the sequel, HAMLET 2, A HAPPIER DANE.

------------------

I saw THE RAID 2 yesterday. Especially liked Hammer Girl and Baseball Boy. My kung fu needs have been met for the next 5 years.

------------------

I saw a screener of OCULUS and loved it. Very scary. I may never eat an apple again.

------------------

CRISIS is damned good, and Gillian Anderson is even better.

------------------

THE ACCIDENT, by Chris Pavone: if you like real nail-biters, this is the best one so far this year.

------------------

Read THE SECRET PLACE, by Tana French, when it comes out. You'll understand then. Great book.

------------------

In Latin, TERMINUS means "End point." Maybe it's just me, but I don't like the sound of that.

------------------

My NCAA picks always make me feel like a fool. Still got Florida, Wisconsin, Louisville, and Baylor. Curse you Harvard!

------------------

Kickstarter will only work if people support the product. VERONICA MARS is a pretty big deal. I hope lots of people go to see it.

------------------

Glad I watched the TRUE DETECTIVE finale on "regular" TV. Spoiler: It was awesome.

------------------

They can replace the Affordable Care Act with...the UNAFFORDABLE Care Act!

------------------

The 2nd season of UNDER THE DOME starts production tomorrow. I'm pretty stoked.

------------------

Best line of the week goes to Eugene, in THE WALKING DEAD: "Trust me. I'm smarter than you."

------------------

@pattonoswalt Great picture! I LOVE Black Widow spiders!

------------------

Reading LOCAL SOULS, by Allan Gurganus, and came across a nice quote attributed to Joe Louis: "I did the best I could with what I had."

------------------

ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK is kind of like THE WALTONS. If the Waltons were all women, that is. And in prison. Good night, Piper/

------------------

If you read Alex Marwood's THE WICKED GIRLS, her new one--THE KILLER NEXT DOOR--is even better. Scary as hell. Great characters.

------------------

ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK: I was dubious at first, but it sort of hits its stride when Piper's hunting for the chicken.

------------------

There's a poster for the CELL movie on DREAD CENTRAL. Very cool. Check it out.

------------------

The new season of UNDER THE DOME is shaping up to be terrific. Chaos and destruction, nobody safe.

------------------

Pete Seeger's organizing the UUA this morning: the Union of United Angels. Gonna miss him here on earth, though.

------------------

That book DOMINION is terrific. And no, this isn't one of those publisher-sponsored blurbs. I just fell in love with it. Nice and long, too.

------------------

@TeeRiddle  I didn't choose the ending of THE DARK TOWER. It chose me. I just wrote it down.

------------------

@CakeGenie He did. So did Philip K. Dick (THE MAN IN THE HIGH CASTLE). There are many ways to de-fur a feline.

------------------

@vamunchkin The BEST Waffle House? I was never in a bad one. They're small and cozy. Smells good. Waffle House rules.

------------------

@linwood_barclay Um...I don't think computer geeks were invented when Marlowe was sleuthing. There WERE paperboys.

------------------

@mikozlowski  STORM OF THE CENTURY is one of my favorites. Sometimes things go right, and there's magic.

------------------

Just saw LABOR DAY. Uneven, but it sure hit my emotional sweet spot. Winslet shines. Nice cameo by Tobey Maguire.

------------------

"If shit was money, poor people would be born without assholes." Read it in Tom Cooper's THE MARAUDERS.

------------------

@wilw Hey, the guys who MAKE crossword puzzles probably have apps up the wazoo, right?

------------------

@SonsofAnarchy Tara's gonna be okay. She's got to be okay. You hearing me? GOT TO BE OKAY.

------------------

Have seen the completed film version of A GOOD MARRIAGE. I thought it was terrific. Of course…I wrote it!

------------------

Finished RED MOON, by Benjamin Percy. A werewolf epic. Can't stop thinking about it.

------------------

@joe_hill The bad guy in Season 2 of AMERICAN HORROR STORY is Bloodyface. When his ID is revealed, I about shit.

------------------

Watching THE RETURNED. Scary and sexy. Fun to see a foreign TV show that hasn't been Americanized. That kid Victor's giving me nightmares.
